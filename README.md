========================

A large Access database driven ASP.NET website create as a term project for the course COMP 3512 at Mount Royal University in the Fall of 2013. The was a massive school project, where I worked with Anthony Thomasson and Paul DeRose to add additional features the the website that we coded for our second assignment in this same class. Boostrap was customized for the front end and the site is fully responsively designed. A three tier model was used to organize and implement the code.
